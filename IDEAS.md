# Main EthosTools.ai -> Tehegram Supplemental Information and Ideas

thoughts about other things for other modules

We should think about things in the case of a failure or something happening and a phone being lost or compromised that has a telegram account linked to it.  

We need a quick reproduceable way of setting up new bots.  Some services will rent or sell bots and they can appear to be in other countries which might be a good idea for people that really want to infiltrate and seem to fit in (say with this polish gang above)

For example, we could have stats that we have 15 agents running on 15 telegram bots monitoring 15 different channels.   We decide that we need 5 more bots and so we can either set up virtual phone numbers for those all if we wanted even.  But we want another 5 bots sitting and waiting for agents so that if someone wants to attach to a channel immediately, an idle telegram bot can receive workflows from an AI agent and it goes and figures out how to join that channel.

If every bot was compromised and exposed, we would be dead in the water.  We would have to potentially go create new API telegram bots, get them running, get AI agents attached to them, and send them out.  Having some hot API bots sitting and waiting for new agents would cut down on time.

We could even offer the ability to have redundant bots join up into the same channel through a selection (How many idling bots do you want to idle)  (What time stagger in between N+1 bot(s) joining?) (Do you want N+1 bot(s) to be used from unique virtual phone numbers?) 

Bots can be purchased cheaply and legally and from whatever country. There might be automated ways to procure bots via an API or just buying a bulk of them.  Things to research about this are 1) can we take control of any of the bots.  2)  Can we bulk order bots that we can assume control of via API or Telegram client?  If we can buy online legally and arm up 1000 bots and just put them into a pool of bots ready to be assigned agent work, for hundreds of dollars- then we should definitely test this out with a few options after researching.  Have AI research this based on the needs.

As more and more agents start being deployed, this is going to tax backend services and things could get ugly real fast - however; we're just building a functional model with ideas but yeah heh.  Didn't realize I was going to
